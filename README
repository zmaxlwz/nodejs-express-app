I use node.js and express as backend server to implement a web application to display database table attributes and allow users to select their interested attributes to further explore.

How to run:

1. first install npm dependency packages:
npm install

2. run the backend server:
node server.js

3. open the web browser and enter the URL:
localhost:8000
